#OpenShift and Atomic Platform Ansible Contrib

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib)

This repo contains *unsupported* code that can be used in conjunction with the
openshift-ansible repository

## Running tests locally
We use [tox](http://readthedocs.org/docs/tox/) to manage virtualenvs and run
tests. Alternatively, tests can be run using
[detox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/detox/) which allows for running tests in
parallel


```
pip install tox detox
```

List the test environments available:
```
tox -l
```

Run all of the tests with:
```
tox
```

Run all of the tests in parallel with detox:
```
detox
```

Running a particular test environment (python 2.7 flake8 tests in this case):
```
tox -e py27-ansible22-flake8
```

Running a particular test environment in a clean virtualenv (python 3.5 yamllint
tests in this case):
```
tox -r -e py35-ansible22-yamllint
```

If you want to enter the virtualenv created by tox to do additional
testing/debugging (py27-flake8 env in this case):
```
source .tox/py27-ansible22-flake8/bin/activate
```
