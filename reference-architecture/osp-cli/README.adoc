== Scripted Installation of OpenShift on OpenStack.

The scripts presented here match those in https://access.redhat.com/articles/2743631[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3 on Red Hat OpenStack Platform 8] reference architecture document.  These script fragments are intended to demonstrate the steps needed to deploy OCP on OSP, but they are not the recommended method for doing so.  Production deployment should be done using the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-on-openstack[OpenShift on OpenStack] Heat templates and the https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible[OpenShift Ansible] playbooks.

The documentation here does not provide comprehensive usage
instructions for these script fragments.  The scripts are meant to be
used in conjunction with the reference architecture document above.

These scripts are offered as-is, and no warranty is implied or offered.

=== Prerequisites

To use these scripts require a DNS server running BIND.
It must have a delegated sub-domain for the OpenShift service.  In
these examples that subdomain is `osp3.example.com`. Adjust this for
the target environment.  The subdomain must allow dynamic updates using
`nsupdate`. The process requires a copy of the `rndc.key`
from the BIND server to allow updates.

The scripts expect a pre-existing `haproxy` proxy server. The user
must have a key-based SSH passwordless access to the proxy server.
The user account on the proxy server must have the ability to execute
commands as root via `sudo`

The `MASTER_DNS_NAME` and `APPS_DNS_SUFFIX` values below must each be
a domain name that refers to the IP address of the haproxy server.

The `APP_DNS_SUFFIX` domain name is a _wildcard record_.  The hostname
portion is an asterisk (*).  This will match any name in that
subdomain.

.Proxy DNS Records 
----
proxy.ocp3.example.com.	300 IN	A	10.19.XX.XX
devs.ocp3.example.com. 300 IN	A	10.19.XX.XX
*.apps.ocp3.example.com.	300 IN	A	10.19.XX.XX
----

A RHEL 7 image must be provisioned into Glance.  Note the
`GLANCE_IMAGE` name below.

There must be an LDAP or Active Directory server available.  There
must be a user and password that can bind to the LDAP server to enable
authentication.

=== Deployment Parameters

These scripts make use of a set of enviroment variables to control the
deployment process. The values listed below must be set in the
caller's environment before invoking the first script.  You can write
them into a file and then `source` them into the environment.

.MANUAL_ENV - Define Installation Variables
----
export MASTER_COUNT=3
export INFRA_NODE_COUNT=3
export APP_NODE_COUNT=2

# Software Version Override
export GLANCE_IMAGE=rhel7
export OCP3_VERSION=3.4
export OSP_VERSION=10

# Instance Specification
export IMAGE_NAME=rhel7
export FLAVOR=m1.small
export OCP3_KEY_NAME=ocp3
export OCP3_KEY_FILE=~/keys/ocp3_rsa
export PUBLIC_NETWORK=public_network

# Naming and DNS 
export OCP3_DOMAIN=ocp3.example.com
export OCP3_DNS_SERVER=10.19.X.X
export OCP3_DNS_UPDATE_KEY=~/keys/dns-update.key

export MASTER_DNS_NAME=devs.ocp3.example.com
export APPS_DNS_SUFFIX=apps.ocp3.example.com

# User Access Control - LDAP server (optional)
export LDAP_BIND_DN=cn=openshift,cn=users,dc=example,dc=com
export LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=password
export LDAP_URL=ldap://ad1.example.com:389/cn=users,dc=example,dc=com?sAMAccountName

=== Red Hat Software Credentials

This procedure requires a valid set of Red Hat Access credentials and a
subscription pool which contains the OCP and OSP repositories for the
selected versions.

Each host must be registered to receive software from the Red Hat RPM
repositories. 

* `rhel-7-server-ose-${OCP_VERSION}-rpms`
* `rhel-7-server-openstack-${OSP_VERSION}-rpms`
* `rhel-7-server-openstack-${OSP_VERSION}-director-rpms`

.rhh_credentials
----
export RHN_USERNAME=<username>
export RHN_PASSWORD=<password>
export RHN_POOL_ID=<pool id>
----

=== Creating the Infrastructure

The first script creates the network and VMs that will make up the
OpenShift cluster.

.Create OSP Infrastructure
----
sh ./infrastructure.sh
----

This creates the bastion host, master, infrastructure node and app
node VMs. This includes updating the DNS and haproxy configurations.

//.Update External Infrastructure Configuration
//sh ./generate_dns_updates.sh
//sh ./generate_haproxy_conf.sh
//----

=== Populate DNS service

The `generate_dns_updates` script can automatically populate the DNS server if the proper variables have been set:

* OCP3_DOMAIN=ocp3.example.com
* OCP3_DNS_SERVER=10.19.X.X
* OCP3_DNS_UPDATE_KEY=~/keys/dns-update.key

----
sh ./generate_dns_updates.sh
----

=== Load Balancer Configuration

The DNS records for the master and app load balancers must exist:

* devs.ocp3.example.com -> loadbalancer IP address
* *.apps.ocp3.example.com -> loadbalancer IP address

The loadbalancer must be configured to forward ports 80 and 443
to the infra-node floating IP addresses and port 8443 must forward to
the master floating IP addresses.

=== Prepare the host instances

This step initializes and customizes the instances for OpenShift
installation via Ansible.

First it configures the bastion host; registering for software repos,
installing Ansible and other tools.  Then it repeats the process with
all of the OpenShift VMs from the bastion host.

.Stage Bastion and instance Configurations
----
sh ./prepare_bastion.sh
sh ./prepare_osp_instances_ansible.sh
----

The final step is to run the OpenShift Ansible installer.  This script
generates the Ansible input files, pushes them to the bastion host and
executes the installation process.

.Install and Configure OpenShift
----
sh ./install_openshift.sh
----


When this is complete and sucessful users will be able to browse to
the OpenShift service masters through the load balancer.
